# Mark Buckler's Personal Website

Github repo for my Hugo based personal/academic website. You can see the site [here](https://www.markbuckler.com/).

Many thanks to [Skand Hurkat](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/skand/) for his
[rework of the Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/skandhurkat/hugo-theme-cornellcsl)

This site depends on an old version of Hugo and is tested with version 0.40.1. To install on Ubuntu:
- `wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.40.1/hugo_0.40.1_Linux-64bit.deb`
- `sudo dpkg -i hugo_0.40.1_Linux-64bit.deb`
