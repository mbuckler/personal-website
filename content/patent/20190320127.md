abstract = "A configurable image processing system can process image data for multiple applications by including an image sensor capable of operating in a machine vision mode and a photography mode in response to an operating system command. When operating in machine vision mode, the image sensor may send image data to first processor for machine vision processing. When operating in photography mode, the image sensor may send image data to an image coprocessor for photography processing."
