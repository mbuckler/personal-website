If you've read my post about
[patenting in academia and industry](http://www.markbuckler.com/post/patenting/)
then you know why you might want to file a patent with your university or
company. The first step to filing a patent in most organizations (after creating
the invention of course!) is filling out an Invention Disclosure Form or IDF.
These forms will be created, provided by, and reviewed by your organization's
technology transfer office or center for technology licensing. While IDFs tend
to differ between organizations they are all intended as a way for the inventor
to communicate to the organization how a new invention works and why it would be
worth patenting. If the result of the organization's review is that the
invention should be patented then in-person meetings with patent attorneys will
be arranged to discuss in more detail.

This post is written as a guide for those of you who might be filling out your
first IDF. I'll describe common questions in IDFs and strategies for
answering these questions well.

1. Who are the inventors?

2. What problem does the invention solve?

	Provide scientific and technical backround material here

3. What prior art are you aware of?

	Patents, papers, documentation

4. What competitors are you aware of?

	Competing products or inventions

5. How does the invention work?

	Use pictures and visual aids whenever possible

6. What are the unique features of the invention?

	Competative advantage over competition and specific novel aspects

7. How could the invention be used?

8. How can the invention be made?

9. Are there any alternative versions of the invention?

	Making the claims as broad as possible

10. What methods exist for detecting if this invention is being used?
