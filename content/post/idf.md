If you read my post all about
[patenting in academia and industry](http://www.markbuckler.com/post/patenting/)
then you know all about why you might want to file a patent with your
organization. The first step to file a patent in most universities and companies
is filling out an Invention Disclosure Form or IDF. While IDFs tend to differ
for each organization, they are all intended as a way for the inventor to
communicate how a new invention works and why it would be worth patenting.
Typically, if the organization agrees that the invention should be patented then
they will set up an in-person meeting with attorneys to discuss specifics.

If this is your first time filling out an IDF then you've come to the right
place! In this post I'll describe common questions in IDFs and strategies for
answering them well.
