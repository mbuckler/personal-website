If you've read my post about
[patenting in academia and industry](http://www.markbuckler.com/post/patenting/)
then you know why you might want to file a patent with your university or
company. The first step to filing a patent in most organizations (after creating
the invention of course!) is filling out an Invention Disclosure Form or IDF.
These forms will be created, provided by, and reviewed by your organization's
technology transfer office or center for technology licensing. While IDFs tend
to differ between organizations they are all intended as a way for the inventor
to communicate to the organization how a new invention works and why it would be
worth patenting. If the result of the organization's review is that the
invention should be patented then in-person meetings with patent attorneys will
be arranged to discuss in more detail.

This post is written as a guide for those of you who might be filling out your
first IDF. I'll describe common questions in IDFs and strategies for
answering these questions well.

1. Who are the inventors?

	Oh boy, the big question! In some cases the answer will be very
straightforward. Perhaps you were the only person on the project in which you
created the invention and you never discussed the invention with others. Most of
the time however the determination of who may or may not be considered an
inventor is a matter of discussion.

	While *authorship* on papers is generally given to people who have made
important contributions when building prototypes, performing testing, and
writing text for the paper, *inventorship* is legally different. Patent law
defines an inventor of a patentable invention as someone who conceives of an
original, useful, and non-obvious idea. This can but does not necessarily
include students, professors, your boss, your employees, and other
collaborators. Use your best judgement to ask all collaborators who you believe
may have contributed to the idea considered in the invention disclosure. Once
everyone involved agrees then the inventor list will be settled. Keep in mind
that inventorship should not be used for charity or flattery. Patents can and
have been invalidated for an incorrect list of inventors. For more information
about this topic, see

provided by Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing.

2. What problem does the invention solve?

	You can think about this section like a combination of the *Background* and
*Motivation* sections in a research paper.
	Provide scientific and technical backround material here

3. What prior art are you aware of?

	Patents, papers, documentation

4. What competitors are you aware of?

	Competing products or inventions

5. How does the invention work?

	Use pictures and visual aids whenever possible

6. What are the unique features of the invention?

	Competative advantage over competition and specific novel aspects

7. How could the invention be used?

8. How can the invention be made?

9. Are there any alternative versions of the invention?

	Making the claims as broad as possible

10. How can the use of this invention be detected?
