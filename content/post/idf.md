If you've read my post about
[patenting in academia and industry](http://www.markbuckler.com/post/patenting/)
then you know why you might want to file a patent with your university or
company. The first step to filing a patent in most organizations (after creating
the invention of course!) is filling out an Invention Disclosure Form or IDF.
These forms will be created, provided by, and reviewed by your organization's
technology transfer office or center for technology licensing. While IDFs tend
to differ between organizations they are all intended as a way for the inventor
to communicate to the organization how a new invention works and why it is
worth patenting. If the result of the organization's review is that the
invention should be patented then in-person meetings with patent attorneys will
be arranged to discuss in more detail.

This post is written as a guide for those of you who might be filling out your
first IDF. I'll describe common questions in IDFs and strategies for
answering these questions well.

1. Who are the inventors?

	In some cases the answer will be very straightforward. Perhaps you were the
only person on the project in which you created the invention and you never
discussed the invention with others. Most of the time, however, people
collaborate. If your invention was made in a project with other people then the
determination of who may or may not be considered an inventor is a matter of
discussion.

	While *authorship* on papers is generally given to people who have made
important contributions when building prototypes, performing testing, and
writing text for the paper, *inventorship* is legally different. Patent law
defines an inventor of a patentable invention as someone who conceives of an
original, useful, and non-obvious idea. This can but does not necessarily
include students, professors, your boss, your employees, and other
collaborators. Use your best judgement to ask all collaborators who you believe
may have contributed to the idea considered in the invention disclosure. Only
after everyone agrees will the inventor list be settled. Keep in mind that who
gets to claim inventorship should not be based on charity, flattery, or spite.
Patents can and have been invalidated for an incorrect list of inventors. For
more information about this topic, see
[this helpful PDF](https://otl.stanford.edu/documents/who_is_inv.pdf)
provided by Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing.

2. What problem does the invention solve?

	For an invention to be useful and therefore worthy of patent protection, it
must solve some problem that exists in the world. If you are used to writing
research papers, you can think of this like the *motivation* section in a
paper. Because the patent lawyers and other people reviewing this IDF won't
necessarily be experts in your field, also make sure to include any scientific
or technical background here that might be needed to understand both why the
invention is useful and how it may work (similar to a *background* section in a
paper).

3. What prior art are you aware of?

	"Prior art" simply refers to any patents, papers, documentation, or other
published information that you are aware of which is related to your invention.
This is similar to the *related work* section in a research paper. If there is a
very large body of work in your field then try to focus on citing survey papers
for the general background and then limit your more specific citations to work
which is closely related. Do your best to list any other groups, researchers, or
companies who work in your area as it will help the attorney's in their further
prior art search.

4. What competitors are you aware of?

	Here you list any competing products or inventions that you're aware of.
Stress the flaws or drawbacks of each of your competitors so that you can more
easily demonstrate your advantage.

5. What are the unique features of the invention?

	Here you describe your invention's competitive advantage and which
specific elements of your invention are novel. You can think about this like the
*contributions* section in a paper. Try to focus both on why you are different
from the competition and why this difference results in a superior product or
method.

6. How does the invention work?

	This is often the most complex section of the IDF. Use pictures and visual
aids whenever possible. You could also consider including a glossary with
definitions of the jargon you use. Keep in mind that the readers may not be as
familiar with your subject area as you are. Technology offices try to match
inventions as closely to experts as possible, but some disciplines can be very
broad and others very specialized.

7. Are there any alternative versions of the invention?

	In engineering we often need to make design decisions to optimize the
performance of our design or simplify the design process. Your final prototype
represents only one possible result for each of the design decisions which
needed to be made in creating the system. If a competitor chooses to 

While you have probably built only one or two prototype of your invention, Making the claims as broad as possible


8. How could the invention be used?

	

9. How can the use of this invention be detected?

10. Who might want to purchase or license the potential patent?
