We all get excited about doing scientific or engineering research for different
reasons, but most of us seek the thrill of creating something entirely new.
In this way, research can be just as wonderful as the creative arts. Publishing
your new ideas is great for sharing information with the world, but sometimes
you want to sell your ideas too. This is where filing for a patent can be very
useful. Personally, I have patented inventions [on my own](http://patents.google.com/patent/US8289363B2),
in [industry](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9344099B2),
and most recently in academia.

Because I can't cover the entire topic of Intellectual Property (IP) law in a
single blog post, I will choose to focus on the process of filing a patent with
a company or university. I hope other researchers and inventors like myself will
find this information useful. Also, I am not a patent attorney. Please don't
take anything that I say here as legal advice!

* What is a patent?

In case you don't already know, a [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent)
on a specific idea gives exclusive usage rights of that idea to whoever holds
the patent. In theory, this means that the patent holder can prevent certain
people from using the idea. These exclusive rights can be used to make money in
a number of ways:

	1. Making and selling products or services with the patented idea
	2. Selling the patent to another organization
	3. Licensing out the patent in exchange for a percentage of sales
	4. Suing for the profits made by an organization who used the patented ideas
	   without your permission



* What about patent abuses?

	Patent trolls (non-practicing entities)

* Can I patent on my own?


* Academia vs Industry


* Is my invention worth patenting?



* When should I file?

	One year rule, first to file in US. Different internationally

* Is my idea better protected as a patent or trade secret?

	Avoiding publication at all helps avoid people designing around a patent
	Especially useful when it is hard to detect if a competitor is using your
technology
	Closed source software

* The Invention Disclosure Form (IDF)
