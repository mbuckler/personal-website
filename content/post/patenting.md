We all get excited about doing scientific or engineering research for different
reasons, but most of us seek the thrill of creating something entirely new.
In this way, research can be just as wonderful as the creative arts. Publishing
your new ideas is great for sharing information with the world, but sometimes
you want to sell your ideas too. This is where filing for a patent can be very
useful. Personally, I have patented inventions [on my own](http://patents.google.com/patent/US8289363B2),
in [industry](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9344099B2),
and most recently in academia.

Because I can't cover the entire topic of [Intellectual Property (IP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) law in a single blog
post, I will choose instead to focus on the process of filing a patent with a
company or university. I hope other researchers and inventors like myself will
find this information useful. Also, I am not a patent attorney, so please don't
take anything that I say here as legal advice!

* What is a patent?

	In case you don't already know, a
[patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent) on a specific idea gives
exclusive usage rights of that idea to whoever holds the patent. In theory, this
means that the patent holder can prevent certain people from using the idea. The
person who creates the invention is referred to as the *inventor*, and the person
or organization who holds the patent once approved is the *assignee*. A patent can
be used to make money in a number of ways:

	1. Making and selling products or services with the patented idea

	2. Selling the patent to another organization

	3. Licensing out the patent in exchange for a percentage of sales

	4. Suing for the profits made by an organization who used the patented ideas
	   without your permission

* What ideas can be patented?

	While patenting restrictions vary between countries and even over time,
most countries now agree that a patentable idea must have all of the following
properties:

	1. Non-abstract

		Mathematical formulas and pure algorithms may be amazing, but these
abstract ideas are not considered to be patentable. What ideas are or are not
abstract can be controversial, and so there are many examples of courts
[invalidating patents after they were issued](https://www.theiplawblog.com/2017/03/articles/patent-law/more-patent-invalidated-as-abstract-ideas/).

	2. Man-made

		Natural laws and natural phenomena are also not patentable. One of the
most prominent examples of a patent portfolio being invalidated for being
natural is the case against Myriad Genetics who previously held a patent on
[breast cancer genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_Genetics#Controversies).

	3. Novel

		Similar to a publication in a research conference or journal, patentable
ideas must be significantly different from what has been published in the past.
Academics usually refer to existing publications as "related work", while patent
attorneys refer to it as "prior art".

	4. Useful

		This is by far the easiest requirement to meet. All that you need to
demonstrate is that your idea successfully accomplishes some goal. That goal
need not be considered useful by a majority of people, it just needs to be
possible and legal. There are all kinds of hilarious
[patents with dubious usefulness](https://www.oddee.com/item_96675.aspx)
that got approved by the USPTO.

	5. Non-obvious

		Every field of engineering and design has a certain set of common
knowledge that an expert in the field would be familiar with. If such an expert
would find an idea to be obvious or common knowledge, then that idea is
considered to be "obvious". Of course this is often a subjective judgement, and
so [see here](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/01/when-is-an-invention-obvious/id=47709/)
for more details.

* Why should I bother patenting if I'm not the assignee?

	Because inventions can be very valuable, most companies and universities
require that you sign some form of a Confidential Information and Inventions
Assignment Agreement (CIIAA) before you join them. The specifics of each CIIAA
vary, but most CIIAA forms force you to give your assignee rights to your
employer for all inventions that you create while employed by them. This means
that if you invent a new product while employed, only your employer can file for
a patent on this invention. Your employer still needs you to perform
your duties as inventor (disclosing your invention and explaining how it works
to the attorneys) though, so companies and universities usually provide inventor
incentives.

	* Incentives in industry

		First of all, while you do give up your assignee rights while employed
you never give up your inventorship. This means that if you file a patent with
your organization then you will still get credit for creating the idea even if
you don't own it. This can be a great option if your organization prohibits
publishing. Second, companies will often provide cash bonuses to you if your
invention disclosure gets approved for filing and also if your filed invention
gets accepted by the patent office.

	* Incentives in academia

		Beyond being self employed or in a startup incubator, academia is the
best work environment to build intellectual property in. A university's goal is
to launch your career rather than make large profits, and as such they usually
give you some amount of profits from and control over your inventions. While
every research university is different it is not uncommon for there to be a
preference to licence patents to inventors themselves in startup companies. Most
universities also give a share of any profits to the inventors. For example,
[Cornell allocates a third of the profits](http://www.ctl.cornell.edu/inventors/marketing-inventions.php)
to the inventor(s).

* Can I patent on my own?

	As long as you aren't under a CIIAA then yes, you can patent on your own.
Fees from the patent office will be reduced because you as a person are a
["micro entity"](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/newsletter/inventors-eye/new-fees-and-micro-entity-status-take-effect-march),
but the cost of hiring a skilled patent attorney may be significant. The best
bet for individual inventors (and sometimes even organizations) is to first file
for a provisional patent application.

* Should I file a provisional patent application?

	While a provisional patent application will not be reviewed by the patent
office and will not become a patent without further applications, it sets the
all important filing date. A lot of work goes into building the claims in a
formal patent application, and so the provisional application allows for a way
to set the date of filing before time has been spent on developing these claims.
Even skilled patent attorneys will often suggest filing a provisional patent
application before continuing to the claims. Provisional applications are also
very low cost as their fees are much smaller than that of a full application.
This makes them a good option for individual or small patent applicants who
haven't yet raised funds for a patent attorney. Keep in mind though that a
provisional application only holds power for a year unless a full patent
application has been filed in that time.

* When should I file?

	In a phrase: As Soon As Possible. You might remember being told in school
that you should date every single entry in your lab/design notebook. That was
because at the time (pre-2013) the US had a "first-to-invent" patenting system.
If someone else was to file for a patent that you had invented first (as proven
by your dated lab notebook), the other person's patent would be invalidated.
This is no longer the case however as the US has
[changed to "first-inventor-to-file"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_to_file_and_first_to_invent#USA_change_to_first-inventor-to-file_(FITF)).
With this in mind, if you want to patent an invention in the US or any other
"first-to-file" country you must file as soon after creating the invention as
possible to prevent others from filing before you.

	Another consideration to keep in mind however is when to patent in
relationship to publishing.

	One year rule, first to file in US. Different internationally


* Is my idea better protected as a patent or trade secret?

	Avoiding publication at all helps avoid people designing around a patent
	Especially useful when it is hard to detect if a competitor is using your
technology
	Closed source software




* Is there such a thing as an international patent?

	Nope! At least at the time of writing there is no such thing as an
international patent or patent office. There is however an International Patent
Cooperation Union which fascilitates a
[single patent filing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty)
for all member countries. While no patent is granted through such an
application, it does provide a unified system for filing dates and applicants
are provided with some written opinions about the patentability of the
invention.

* The Invention Disclosure Form (IDF)

	Most companies or universities provide a form for you to file with their
center for technology licensing. 


* Who is an inventor?
