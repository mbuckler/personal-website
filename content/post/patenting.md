We all get excited about doing scientific or engineering research for different
reasons, but most of us seek the thrill of creating something entirely new.
In this way, research can be just as wonderful as the creative arts. Publishing
your new ideas is great for sharing information with the world, but sometimes
you want to sell your ideas too. This is where filing for a patent can be very
useful. Personally, I have patented inventions [on my own](http://patents.google.com/patent/US8289363B2),
in [industry](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9344099B2),
and most recently in academia.

Because I can't cover the entire topic of [Intellectual Property (IP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) law in a single blog
post, I will choose instead to focus on the process of filing a patent with a
company or university. I hope other researchers and inventors like myself will
find this information useful. Also, I am not a patent attorney. Please don't
take anything that I say here as legal advice!

* What is a patent?

	In case you don't already know, a
[patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent) on a specific idea gives
exclusive usage rights of that idea to whoever holds the patent. In theory, this
means that the patent holder can prevent certain people from using the idea. The
person who creates the invention is referred to as the *inventor*, and the person
or organization who holds the patent once approved is the *assignee*. A patent can
be used to make money in a number of ways:

	1. Making and selling products or services with the patented idea

	2. Selling the patent to another organization

	3. Licensing out the patent in exchange for a percentage of sales

	4. Suing for the profits made by an organization who used the patented ideas
	   without your permission

* Why should I bother patenting in my company or university?

	Because inventions can be very valuable, most companies and universities
require that you sign some form of a Confidential Information and Inventions
Assignment Agreement (CIIAA) before you join them. The specifics of each CIIAA
vary, but most CIIAA forms force you to give your assignee rights to your
employer for all inventions that you create while employed by them. This means
that if you invent a new product while employed, only your employer can file for
a patent on this invention. Because your employer still needs you to perform
your duties as inventor (disclosing your invention and explaining how it works
to the attorneys), both companies and universities usually provide inventor
incentives.

	First of all, while you do give up your assignee rights while employed you
never give up your inventorship. This means that if you file a patent with your
organization then you will still get credit for creating the idea even if you
don't own it. This can be a great option if your organization prohibits
publishing. Second, companies will often provide cash bonuses to you if your
invention disclosure gets approved for filing and also if your filed invention
gets accepted by the patent office.

	In a university things are a bit different since you are expected to be
publishing all of your new ideas. Patenting can be a bit of an afterthought for
some, but it shouldn't be that way!

* What about patent abuses?

	Patent trolls (non-practicing entities)

* Can I patent on my own?


* Academia vs Industry


* Is my invention worth patenting?



* When should I file?

	One year rule, first to file in US. Different internationally

* Is my idea better protected as a patent or trade secret?

	Avoiding publication at all helps avoid people designing around a patent
	Especially useful when it is hard to detect if a competitor is using your
technology
	Closed source software

* The Invention Disclosure Form (IDF)
