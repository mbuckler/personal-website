This is the third in a series of three posts teaching you how to DJ!  
Part 1: [What You Need to Start DJing](/post/what-you-need-djing)  
Part 2: [How to Learn DJ Basics](/post/learn-djing-basics)  
Part 3: [How to Make a DJ Mix](/post/how-to-mix)  

Alright, you've got your DJ gear and you've practiced a few transitions. Now is
the time to dig into the meat of DJing: creating your mix. Below I describe my
personal method, but as I've mentioned before there are many ways to succeed. If
you want to use Traktor instead of Rekordbox, ignore cue points completely,
never organize your music, or anything else go ahead! Just make sure that you're
having fun and that you like the sound of your mix.

Also, if you get stuck at any point that's OK! There are often ways to make
things easier for yourself. For example, I often recommend that new DJs practice
on House music since the clear repetitive beat is great for learning beat
matching and the long intros and outros make mixing a bit easier. As another
example, lets say you're struggling to find songs with the right key and BPM. No
worries! You can search around for more tracks on Beatport to expand your
library, giving yourself more options. Also, feel free to drop any questions you
have below.

Alright, lets get started!

## Instructions for how to make a DJ mix!

5. Organize your music library

    Some people have an insanely good memory and can easily remember what songs
they want to play for any given mood or genre. I am not that kind of person! For
me, I find it very helpful to do a few small things whenever I load in new music
that help me down the line. Here I'll explain what I do for each new track and
why I find it helpful.

    When creating a new mix or playing live you will often be interested in
finding tracks which fit a certain mood, are a certain genre, or even just songs
that you personally think are really good. While BPM and key are easy to filter
by since they are automatically analyzed by Rekordbox, there is no feature for
analyzing mood, genre, or your personal taste. Whenever I add new music into my
library I will first analyze the tracks to get BPM and key, but then I will
label each track. By labeling I mean that I add labels in brackets in the
Comments section of each track which describe the genre, mood, and anything else
I might like to sort by later. I also rate the track from 0-5 stars using
Rekordbox's built in Rating column. As an example, in the Comments section of
one of my favorite songs called [Kingslayer by Caster &
Ironheart](https://soundcloud.com/ophelia_records/caster-ironheart-kingslayer)
I've written: "\[Dubstep\], \[Epic\], \[Orchestral\]" and I've rated it 5 stars.
When labeling a song I try to have at least one label for genre and mood
respectively, but the beauty of these labels is that you only need to use labels
that are helpful for you when sorting. Speaking of sorting, these labels can
then be used by an awesome feature in Rekordbox called [intelligent
playlists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCIzg-84xM&ab\_channel=DirtySecretz).
Each new intelligent playlist will pull songs from your entire collection based
on a few rules that you set. For example, I have an intelligent playlist for
Dubstep, which includes all tracks that contain the text "\[Dubstep\]" in their
comments. This means that every time I add a new track and label it as Dubstep,
it will automatically be added to this playlist. I've set up intelligent
playlists for all of my favorite genres and moods, making it very easy for me to
find what I need!
