# Biography

I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering
department here at Cornell University. I'm advised by [Prof Adrian
Sampson](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/).

My graduate research focuses on efficient computer vision.
In my work I've found that abstractions can simplify the design process,
but breaking down boundaries through hardware-software co-design can
produce superior results. For this reason I see myself as a system
creator rather than a hardware or software developer.

As an entrepreneurial engineer I quickly gravitated to both industrial
and academic research. While finishing my M.S. at UMass Amherst I formed
[Firebrand Innovations](http://www.firebrandinnovations.com/) as a way
of monetizing intellectual property I developed while in high school.
These days I can be found in Cornell's [Computer Systems
Laboratory](http://www.csl.cornell.edu/) plugging away at code for
powerful new computer vision systems.
