# Biography

I would describe myself as an endlessly curious, ambitious, and creative person. In all my work I
begin by identifying the most important goals and questioning any built-in assumptions. This first
principles approach frequently leads me to unique solutions which span multiple levels of hierarchy.
Iâ€™ve made contributions in many fields including
[generative AI](https://www.harmonai.org/),
[robotics](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/meet-scout),
[biomedical imaging](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210312622A1/en),
[computer vision](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Buckler_Reconfiguring_the_Imaging_ICCV_2017_paper.html),
[hardware acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06312),
and [computer architecture](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9294263B2/en).

My passion for deep learning, computer vision, and hardware design was super-charged during my PhD
in [Prof Adrian Sampson's](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) research group at Cornell University. [My thesis](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/67614) focused on
hardware-software co-design for computer vision and deep learning.

My entrepreneurial spirit has led me to found the [Codex Collective](https://www.instagram.com/codex_collective/), an electronic music event
production company which I currently run, and [Firebrand Innovations](http://www.firebrandinnovations.com/), which sold [patents on
videoconferencing](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8289363B2/en) that I developed while in high school. In addition to running music events with
my team at Codex Collective, I also enjoy [writing music](https://soundcloud.com/quoththeraver) and [DJing](https://www.instagram.com/quoth_the_raver/) at clubs around Seattle.
