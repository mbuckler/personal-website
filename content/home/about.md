# Biography

I would describe myself as an endlessly curious, ambitious, and creative person. In all my work I
begin by identifying the most important goals and questioning any built-in assumptions. This first
principles approach frequently leads me to unique solutions which span multiple levels of hierarchy.
Iâ€™ve made contributions in many fields including
[generative AI](https://soundry.ai/),
[robotics](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/meet-scout),
[biomedical imaging](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210312622A1/en),
[computer vision](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Buckler_Reconfiguring_the_Imaging_ICCV_2017_paper.html),
[hardware acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06312),
and [computer architecture](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9294263B2/en).

My passion for AI, deep learning, and hardware acceleration was super-charged during my PhD
in [Prof Adrian Sampson's](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) research group at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). [My thesis](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/67614) focused on
hardware-accelerated deep learning for computer vision.

My entrepreneurial spirit has led me to found three companies so far: [Firebrand
Innovations](http://www.firebrandinnovations.com/) which sold videoconferencing
IP, [Codex Collective](https://codexcollective.co/press-kit)
which produces electronic music events in Seattle, and most recently
[Soundry AI](https://soundry.ai/) which provides an AI text-to-sample generator
for music producers & songwriters. In my free time I enjoy [writing
music](https://soundcloud.com/quoththeraver) and
[DJing](https://www.instagram.com/quoth_the_raver/).
