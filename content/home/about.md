# Biography

I'm currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon where I help this [cute little
robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peaKnkNX4vc) see the world with fast and
energy efficient computer vision. I recently graduated with a PhD in Electrical
and Computer Engineering from Cornell University. In my research I was advised
by [Prof Adrian Sampson](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/).

My graduate research focused on efficient computer vision. I've found that
abstractions can simplify the design process, but breaking down boundaries
through hardware-software co-design can produce superior results. For this
reason I see myself as a system creator rather than a hardware or software
developer.

As an entrepreneurial engineer I quickly gravitated to both industrial and
academic research. While finishing my M.S. at UMass Amherst I formed [Firebrand
Innovations](http://www.firebrandinnovations.com/) as a way of monetizing
intellectual property I developed while in high school. These days I can be
found in Amazon's robotics lab plugging away at code for powerful new computer
vision systems.
