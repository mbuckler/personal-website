      <description>Biography I&amp;rsquo;m currently a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department here at Cornell University. I&amp;rsquo;m advised by Prof Adrian Sampson.
My graduate research focusses on hardware for embedded computer vision. In my work I&amp;rsquo;ve found that abstractions can simplify the design process, but breaking down boundaries through hardware-software co-design can produce superior results. For this reason I see myself as a system creator rather than a hardware or software developer.</description>

      <title>All About Invention Disclosures</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read my post about patenting in academia and industry then you know why you might want to file a patent with your university or company. The first step to filing a patent in most organizations (after creating the invention of course!) is filling out an Invention Disclosure Form or IDF. These forms will be created, provided by, and reviewed by your organization&amp;rsquo;s technology transfer office or center for technology licensing.</description>

      <description>We all get excited about doing scientific or engineering research for different reasons, but most of us seek the thrill of creating something entirely new. In this way, research can be just as wonderful as the creative arts. Publishing your new ideas is great for sharing information with the world, but sometimes you want to sell your ideas too. This is where filing for a patent can be very useful. I have some experience in this area as I have patented inventions on my own, in industry, and most recently in academia.</description>

      <title>Cutting Videos with FFmpeg</title>
      <link>http://markbuckler.com/post/cutting-ffmpeg/</link>

      <description>While building the downloading and decoding scripts for the Youtube BoundingBoxes dataset I needed to accurately cut videos into smaller clips. Some of the annotated videos were quite long and the annotations rarely covered the full video, so to save space my scripts cut out and save only the annotated sections. If done incorrectly this video cutting can cause subtle frame timing issues which I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand when I started writing these scripts.</description>

      <title>My Old Electronic Music Blog</title>

      <description>Back in 2010 I started a blog dedicated to electronic music called Quoth the Raver (a play on Quoth the Raven). It was a huge amount of fun sharing the music I found with everyone on the site, and it inspired me to get even more familiar with the various genres, artists, and labels. These days electronic music (also known as EDM) has exploded in popularity, so the novelty of sharing new artists has worn off to a certain extent.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Accelerator with Logarithmic Number System</title>
      <link>http://markbuckler.com/project/lns-neural-accel/</link>

      <guid>http://markbuckler.com/project/lns-neural-accel/</guid>
      <description>For my final project in Cornell&amp;rsquo;s Complex ASIC Design course I built a neural network accelerator which used the Logarithmic Number System (LNS). There has been some interest in using the LNS with neural networks as neural computation is multiplication heavy and multiplications in the LNS can be implemented with a simple adder. I augmented a PyMTL implementation of a single threaded PARCv2 processor with instructions to convert between LNS and fixed point, add LNS numbers, and multiply LNS numbers.</description>

      <title>Writing LaTeX in Vim</title>

      <description>As an academic I am often writing LaTeX code for publications or general documentation. I used to use ShareLatex and Overleaf because I have a secret love of GUIs (Lord forgive me!), but recently my co-authors have prefered to work in LaTeX repos shared on GitHub. For this reason my most recent paper was actually written entirely in Vim! This post isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a complete description of the best way to edit LaTeX in Vim, but instead I want to share some of the tools, tricks, and tips that I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful when writing LaTeX in Vim.</description>

      <title>Configurable Imaging Sensor</title>

      <description>While most image sensors can be configured to output a subset of their total resolution, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually lead to energy savings as might have been expected [LiKamWa-2013]. LiKamWa et al. explored energy saving methods possible when using existing sensors, but our project took the idea further by making a new energy-proportional image sensor. Suren Jayasuriya and I did this by adding power gating transistors to the amplifier and ADC in each of the sensor&amp;rsquo;s readout columns.</description>

      <title>Developing in Docker</title>

      <description>Most of us academic/industrial ECE/CS researchers want to make our results as reproducible as possible. Its good for the integrity of our field and it also helps future researchers and developers to build on our prior work. GitHub is great for distributing software, but code can rarely be compiled and run on its own as nearly all modern software relies heavily on packages and dependencies. Installing these dependencies can be incredibly frustrating or possibly even impossible depending on how long ago the code was written.</description>

      <title>How to Install NVIDIA GPU Drivers &amp; CUDA</title>
      <link>http://markbuckler.com/post/install-cuda/</link>

      <description>Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s set up a new Linux based, GPU enabled, deep learning system knows the horror that is driver installation. While it is technically possible to install NVIDIA drivers and CUDA from your package manager, the most up to date versions aren&amp;rsquo;t available and in the worst case you might even break graphics on your machine. After a great deal of difficulties installing and reinstalling, I finally found a viable strategy: installing both CUDA and proprietary Linux drivers from an NVIDA run file without OpenGL libraries.</description>
